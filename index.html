<h2>Rock on!</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>Dodge the asteroids moving around the screen as long as you can.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>Sci-fi is the most fitting theme but it's mostly about asteroids.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>Mouse input, randomly generated asteroids, and a timer.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>Have fun! Try not to get frustrated if you die quickly.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>Dodge rocks and survive as long as possible. You can move the Earth around as much as you want but you have no controls besides that. 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>Mouse input and constant random generation of sprites.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>Very prettty rocks and a positive attitude
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>SPAAAAAACE
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>In a world where rocks are constantly flying at you at incredible speeds. You must survive the onslaught until the end of time.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>Anyone who can use a mouse and see a screen.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>Probably no more than a minute or two.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>Dodge ALL the rocks!
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>Assets taken from web images: EARTH: http://www.clker.com/clipart-earth-cartoon.html ASTEROID: http://www.nbcnews.com/id/43785385/ns/technology_and_science-space/t/its-official-nasa-spacecraft-orbiting-giant-asteroid/  

</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>A lot of flash games use the same mechanics of dodging something using your mouse.
</li>

</ul>
